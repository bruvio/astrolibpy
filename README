This library contains a few useful routines I wrote or I converted from IDL.

If you have found a bug or have a patch, you can send them to me. 
With my library I do not promise a stable interface, so beware.

The licensing for the programs I wrote myself is GPL3. For all other
programs (mainly converted from IDL) I guess the license is either BSD or 
they are in public domain. 

The tools that may be still interesting to users are 
idlsave.py -- module for saving restoring variables 
lasso_plot -- module for selecting points by drawing a contour
clicker -- module for extracting one or many clicks coordinates from matplotlib plot
crossmatcher -- module for x-matching a table with the table inside postgresql database
match_lists -- x-match lists by position on the sky using kd-tree
mpfit -- Levenberg-Marquardt fitter (converted from IDL)

The astrolib part of this repo is probably obsolete with the arrival of astropy
