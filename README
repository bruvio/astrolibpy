This library contains a few useful routines I wrote or I converted from IDL. 

My contacts are:

If you have found a bug or have a patch, you can send them to me. 
With my library I do not promise a stable interface, so beware.

The licensing for the programs I wrote myself is GPL3. For all other
programs (mainly converted from IDL) I guess the license is either BSD or 
they are in public domain.
